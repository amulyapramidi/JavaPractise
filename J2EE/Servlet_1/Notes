Notes 
~~~~~~
1. "service()" is for all input requests irrespective of Http protocol or anything else.
2. To write to output use below two methods :
a) response.getWriter().write("output");
b) response.getOutputStream().print("output");
-> If (a) is already used before (b) getting error illegal state
3. Servlet vs GenericServlet vs HttpServlet
a) This gives only service() method. You don't have doGet or doPost to override. Apart from service,
getServletConfig, init such generic methods also requested to implement. To be iplemented.
b) This gives only service() method. You don' have doGet or doPost to override. Won't handle Https. To be
extended. 
c) This doesn't give any methods. User can override doGet, doPost methods. Must have same signature as
parent. To be extended.
4. If using input data from from, use 'name' not 'id' while getting data from request object.
