Final : 
~~~~~~~

Use when you don't want someone to override your functionality.
-> Prevent the class to be subclassed by any other class:

public final class ParentClass {
} 

-> Prevent child class to override a method in parent class :

public class ParentClass {
    public final void performAction() {
    }
} 
Whent to use :

Use when you want to restrict overriding functionality -  want to give limited access to children class. 
This is particularly important to library developers as the design decisions like that could significantly limit the applicability of the library.

Java standard library has some examples of final classes, with most known being String class.
On an early stage, the decision has been taken to proactively prevent any developer’s attempts to come up with own, 
“better” string implementations.
