Things I have learnt:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. ApplicationContext is needed to load beans.xml
2. In bean, list dependency can also be injected
3. A bean and be inserted in another bean using auto-wire
4. There are different types of Auto-Wiring- byType and byName
5. byName needs match of setter variable name
6. If the nested bean name is modified - need to regenerate setter again
7. To auto-wire a bean there are 2 days
a) Using <property name="Laptop" ref="bean_name">
b) Mentioning auto-wire="byType/byName" in parent bean node.
8. Type of list supported by spring is java.util.List
9. Have to findout why just mentioning annotation like @Autowired and @Component didn't work.
