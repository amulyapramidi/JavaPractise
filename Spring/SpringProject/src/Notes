Things I have learnt:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. ApplicationContext is needed to load beans.xml
2. In bean, list dependency can also be injected
3. A bean and be inserted in another bean using auto-wire
4. There are different types of Auto-Wiring- byType and byName
5. byName needs match of setter variable name
6. If the nested bean name is modified - need to regenerate setter again
7. To auto-wire a bean there are 2 days
a) Using <property name="Laptop" ref="bean_name">
b) Mentioning auto-wire="byType/byName" in parent bean node.
8. Type of list supported by spring is java.util.List
9. Have to findout why just mentioning annotation like @Autowired and @Component didn't work.
Annotaion Scan :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

10. For annotations to be scanned, following in beans.xml
 		<context:component-scan base-package="com.amulya.spring" />
 		This requires xmlns differences so old beans.xml won't work directly.
11. Following is line to remember 
By default, Spring will lower case the first character of the component – from ‘CustomerService’ to ‘customerService’.
And you can retrieve this component with name ‘customerService’.
