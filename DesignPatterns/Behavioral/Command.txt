Issue : In scenarios where you want to execute commands, instead of directly using the receiver object, creating different commandor and receiver objects.
A request is wrapped as an object as command and passed to invoker.
Command interface, CommandClass created implementing Command-> provides setter and getter on Receiver. Invoker -> can set Command and execute CommandClass.
