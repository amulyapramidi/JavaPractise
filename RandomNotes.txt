Goal : To design a system that includes client-app, services & database which come together for a user experience where client can book cabs.

Brief : 
The geopgrahical area of a city is broken down into boxes of 1Km X 1Km each having unique ID.
Whenever a client requests for cab, a radius(Say 2kms) is decided and all the cabs inside that radius are found out. Based on ETA, calculated based
on distance from source (via possible roads) , the request is sent about coming request to the selected cab driver.

While going through this found frequent reference to a concept called "Consistent Hashing".
